Developer Notes:

11/10/2024:  Finished creating the first draft of the recipe format, and linking it to a database.  Took about 3 hours.
11/11/2024:  Started work on the Login Screen.  Took about an hour.
11/12/2024:  Streamed a bit of my progress.  Working on connecting the databases.  Had to use ChatGPT to process the login.
			 Having trouble with the encryptString function; PHP won't recognize it.  So that was another hour.  Stopped at
			 around 7PM, because I have work at 7AM tomorrow.
			 
			 Per ChatGPT, here's what I want to do in the future:
			 
			 1. Fix the login issues, possibly remove the need for the encryptString() function.  Consider decrypting them before
				making the prepared statements.  Use plenty of echos to spot the issue.
			 2. Make a logout feature, so users can log out.
			 3. Create a Sign Up feature, and include age limits and password requirements.
			 4. Create a Profile page in order to create the Delete Account feature.
			 
			 For the next few weeks, just focus on this, before you work on the recipe part of the website.  Get the login system right first.
			 Once you get the login system right, then outline, outline, outline concerning posting and sharing recipes.  This will be a 
			 long journey.  Embrace each step.
			 
			 Oh, and here's some ideas for future projects:
			 
			 * A website displaying housing prices in America in the form of Monopoly values.  Get a list of all counties in the USA, and get 
			   median housing prices, median rents, etc.  Consider finding an API of that data and some geographical information, they probably
			   have that for election maps anyway.

11/13/2024:  Finally got the encryptString issue resolved.  Now I can log in.  Now I just need to figure out how I can display the username!  $_SESSION
			 is still undefined when you go into the main page.  I spent about half an hour on it.  Probably gonna stop for now.
			 6:20PM  OK seriously, stop.  You've done enough for now.  Think about your regular job!
			 
11/17/2024:	 Huge hurdle overcame:  Don't call a function encryptString() because there's already a function of that name.  I changed it, and now it works
			 beautifully.  Got the log out function working.  Started the skeleton for the signup code.  Took about an hour for everything, maybe an hour
			 and a half.
			 
11/24/2024:  Started at 8:17AM.  Stopped at 8:46AM.  Apparently having some issues with the CSS.  It worked last time.  At least I've made progress on the
			 HTML of the Signup form, which wasn't too hard.  I think I'm going to stop for now.
			 
			 Started again at 1:06PM to begin troubleshooting.  Fixed the issue, and stopped at 1:16PM.  Check video for details.
			 Started again at around 1:48PM to add a new recipe to the database.  Got a few issues with the trailing zeroes in the quantities, want to clean that up.
			 Stopped at 3:22PM.  The sign up credential checks work, but I can't send an email to Gmail beacuse of security issues.
11/25/2024:  Started at 9:44AM.  I plan on doing this off and on.  OK, stopped at 9:58AM.  Don't want to use the Internet too much right now.
			 Restarted at 11:00AM, off and on.  Paused at 11:14AM.
			 Restarted at 1:25PM, off and on I might add.  Stopped at 2:06PM.  I have completed a good portion of the login and sign up screens.  Now what I need to
			 do is figure out a "Forgot Password" page that doesn't require an email.  I still need to think on that.
			 Let's see, 14 minutes, 14 minutes, 41 minutes, so about an hour.
			 Developer Notes moved to separate file.
			 
			 So, future tasks:
			 
			 1. Create A "Forgot Password" page that doesn't require email.
			 2. Create a Profile page in order to create the Delete Account feature.
			 
			 In addition, before I even start on editing recipes, I must create an admin page in order to ban users.
			 
			 Restarted at 5:17PM?  Stopped at 5:32PM.

11/27/2024:  Started at 5:46PM for a little bit.  Stopped at 5:49PM.

12/ 1/2024:  Started at 4:28PM.  Paused at 5:28PM.  I'm probably going to stop for now (at 5:38PM).  Made some good progress.  I'm working on the Settings screen, 
			 and making new .php files for repeating code, such as modals, and login_process.
		
12/ 3/2024:  Started at 6:28PM.  Stopped at 7:01PM.  (Good thing I stopped.  I would have gone all night.)  Anyway, repeating code works, changing the given name works,
			 and I'm able to delete accounts.  However, I need to give a message saying that the username/password combo is not found.  So that's something to
			 work on next time.  So...33 minutes?  Not bad.
			 
12/ 4/2024:  Started at 4:59PM.  Paused at 5:36PM.  Resumed at 5:37PM.  After a short pause, stopped at 5:59PM.  Decided to revert to the old code from the flash drive,
			 because PHP's having issue with the headers.  A new file has been made for reference, login_process_alt.php.
			 
12/13/2024:  Started at around 5:30PM.  Already found an issue:  I didn't test for duplicate usernames.  Paused at 5:40PM.  Resumed at 5:45PM.
			 A few off and ons later, Finished at 6:56PM.  I think I've gotten a handle on the login screen, everything should work.  If not, I can fix it.  Now I feel 
			 comfortable with starting on the recipe editing feature.  I know I'll need to go back to the login screen to integrate email into it, but for now, the bare
			 bones pretty much work.  I think I'll stop for tonight.  Let's see, this took about 80 minutes?  Not bad.
			 
12/14/2024:  I'm starting to write notes on physical paper on the format of the recipe editor, and then I'll probably stop for today.  I'm not timing this, I'm just brainstorming 
             ideas.  I also want to brainstorm how to make a condensed display, that is expandable upon clicking.  
			 
			 So, future tasks:
			 
			 1. Create the skeleton for the recipe editor.
			 2. Alphabetize the Tag names.
			 3. Make a profile page for your recipes.
			 4. Make a feature on the front page where users can select certain tags, and certain recipes will pop-up.  Like a search page.
			 5. Add likes and dislikes.  Add comments.
			 6. Add the ability to flag recipes for being inappropriate (such as recipes for illegal substances) 
			 7. Add the ability to follow and unfollow people.
			 8. Add the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy Pages.
			 9. Add an About Page.
			10. Port it to a new hosting service.
			
12/15/2024:  Started at 3:23PM.  Worked off and on.  Stopped at 4:51PM.  Got the skeleton of the Insert Recipe page form done.  I'm a little winded now.  Took about 80 minutes.

12/16/2024:  Started at around 5:04PM.  Playing with C# for another project, while dabbling with RecipeGate.
			 6:23PM: tag addition and subtraction work.  You can even have 0 tags if you want!
			 Ended at 6:48.  Ingredient additions and subtractions work.  Next time (Lord willing), work on the CSS!
			 So, tonight's session took 1 hour 44 minutes, give or take a few minutes.  I was even in the zone, once I figured out a few things!  But that's enough coding for 
			 tonight, especially since it's a school night.
			 
12/17/2024:  Started at 5:12PM.  Paused, after being off a few minutes, at 5:38PM.
			 Resumed at 5:45PM.  Stopped at 6:45PM.  I got started with the recipe_process page by extracting all the fields, which are variable.  Next time is the fun part,
			 actually putting it into the database, yay!  Let's see...26 minutes less about 5 minutes, then a whole hour.  So, I'd say, 1 hour 21 minutes tonight.
			 The next part is going to take a while, so that's why I'm stopping a little early.
			 
			 (So far, the whole development of this website has taken me 18 hours and 53 minutes, over a period of 5 weeks and 2 days, which is a rate of about 214.35 minutes
			 per week, or about 3 and a half hours a week.  Yes, it's a slow start, but it's better than nothing.  I can bump that up to about 7.5 hours a week if I keep up this
			 current pace. 
			 
			 ChatGPT tells me that for one person to finish this website, it would require between 300 and 400 hours, equivalent to 8-10 weeks of full-time work. So far, I'm at less
			 than one week.  Let's see how it goes!
			 
12/18/2024:  Started at 4:58PM.  Off and on.  Paused at 5:32PM for supper.  Restarted at 5:46PM.
             6:02PM :  After fixing the syntax errors, I'm super surprised it worked the first time! WOW!
			 Stopped at 6:12PM.  I think my next task is to work more on the like/dislike/flag buttons (I made a div tag for that), as well as an expand/contract button 
			 (use &blacktriangledown and $blacktriangle).  I'm at a decent stopping point.  Took about 55 minutes tonight.
			 
12/22/2024:  Started at 12:48PM. Off and on.  Stopped at 1:35PM for now.  Took about 40 minutes.
			 Restarted at 3:23PM, off and on (I'm also installing GMod).  Stopped at 3:27PM.  4 minutes.
			 
			 Next time:  Go over your old code, and introduce JQuery AJAX to process the "likes" without exiting the page.
			 
			 Restarted at around 3:38PM.  Stopped at 4:53PM.  Programmed the like button to at least work.  And yes, you can like your own recipes.  Why not?  If YOU think it's
			 a banger, it still counts.  Took about 70 minutes.  Total:  114 minutes.
			 
12/23/2024:  Started at 12:38PM.  Paused at 1:02PM.   24 minutes.
			 Resumed at 1:08PM.  Stopped at around 1:12 or 1:17PM.  Probably not going to continue today; too much to do for the holidays.   4 minutes.
			 Resumed at 2:03PM.  Apparently, not too much to do.  Let's continue.  Paused at 2:58PM.  Flag button done.  About 50 minutes.
			 
			 Before we continue, let's go over what we need to do:
			 
			 1. Generate a complaint report for the admins (I'll probably do part of this and then stop today.)
			 2. Add in an "Original Author" field on the Insert Recipe modal.
			 3. Make a profile page for users.  Allow people to follow their favorite users.
			 4. Make a search feature for certain recipes and categories.
			 5. Put more recipes in the database.  In fact, generate a Python program to do just that (that would be fun!)
			 6. Make a "Next Page" or "Previous Page" for recipies.
			 7. Tweak the recipe algorithm.
			 8. Make an About page, a Terms of Use page, and a Privacy Policy page.
			 9. I think that's it!  By then, it should be ready to publish!
			 
			 OK, I think I'm done for today.  Too much that may have to be done today.  Total time:  78 minutes.
			 
			 Ok, MAYBE resumed at 6:35PM.  Now done at 7:11PM.  That took about 30 minutes.  Total time: 108 minutes.
			 
12/28/2024:  Started at 10:27AM.  Stopped at 11:03AM.  Worked more on the Report Manager page and starting on the complaint processing code.
		     Started at 4:14PM.  Paused at 4:40PM.  
			 Resumed at 4:45PM, off and on.  Paused at 5:21PM.
			 Resumed at 5:23PM.  Ened at 5:51PM.  Added the "Original Author" field as well as worked on the Report Manager page.  That should be finished by now.
			 
			 OK, Let's go over what we need to do next:
			 
			 3. Make a profile page for users.  Allow people to follow their favorite users.
			 4. Make a search feature for certain recipes and categories.
			 5. Put more recipes in the database.  In fact, generate a Python program to do just that (that would be fun!)
			 6. Make a "Next Page" or "Previous Page" for recipies.
			 7. Tweak the recipe algorithm.
			 8. Make an About page, a Terms of Use page, and a Privacy Policy page.
			 9. I think that's it!  By then, it should be ready to publish!

			 Time wise:  36 minutes, 26 minutes	, 26 minutes, 28 minutes.  Total is 116 minutes, let's make that more like 110 for good measure.

12/29/2024:  Started at 12:16PM.  Paused at 12:41PM.
			 Resumed at  2:10PM.  Stopped at around 2:50PM.  
			 Time wise: 25 + 40 minutes: 65 minutes.
			 
12/30/2024:  Not sure when I started.  Had to start over from the backup files.  So, let's just say about an hour.

			 Next tasks to do:  Fix the redirect of the likes, and figure out how to keep it on the..you know
			 what you can do next time?  Try to use an AJAX function to put the result in the HTML to show the updated like.
			 Just a thought.
			 
			 Anyway, profile page is somewhat done.  You can at least "follow" your favorite recipe submitters.
			 In Step 7, that's when you can actually show your favorites.  But first, we need more recipes!
			 One step at a time, hoss.
			 
			 Next time:
			 
			 4. Make a search feature for certain recipes and categories.
			 5. Put more recipes in the database.  In fact, generate a Python program to do just that (that would be fun!)
			 6. Make a "Next Page" or "Previous Page" for recipies.
			 7. Tweak the recipe algorithm.
			 8. Make an About page, a Terms of Use page, and a Privacy Policy page.
			 9. I think that's it!  By then, it should be ready to publish!

12/31/2024:  Started at 3:44PM.  Ended at 3:49PM.  I don't really know where to begin with the search bar.
			 What do I search for?  Tags?  Authors?  Recipes?  I need to do some more research before I continue.
			 
			 Oh, I also hid the follow button to those who are not logged in.
			 
1/4/2025:    Need to remember to make a way to edit the recipe.
			 Started at 2:25PM.  Paused at 2:50PM.  25 minutes.
			 Resumed at 3:05PM.  Paused at 3:42PM.  Needed to get comfy.  37 minutes.
			 Resumed at 3:44PM.  Stopped at 4:28PM.  Next time, continue to work on the edit feature. 44 minutes.
			 Total time: 106 minutes.
			 
1/5/2025:    Started at 1:48PM.  Paused at 2:46PM.  58 minutes.
             Resumed at 2:56PM (for a tutorial).  Stopped tutorial at 8:22 of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxMBHi_ZiT8.  Paused at 3:22PM.  
			 Resumed at 3:28PM. Stopped at around 4:18PM, then finished the last minute or two.  76 minutes of tutorial time.
			 Worked on it a little more for about an hour.  60 minutes.
			 Total time: 194 minutes.
			 
1/7/2025:    Started at 4:13PM.  Working on building a mass recipe generator in Python.
			 Paused at 5:13PM.  The ChatGPT program for Python is way too slow.  I'll have to insert recipes manually.  60 minutes, 10 of which was on RecipeGate.
			 Resumed at 5:40PM.  Stopped at 7:30PM.  Need to activate the search bar link, both by clicking the search button,
			 and pressing enter on the search bar.  Still a work in progress. 110 minutes.
