This is currently a work in progress.  The following features still need to be worked on:

1. Generate a complaint report page for the admins.
2. Add in an "Original Author" field on the Insert Recipe modal.
3. Make a profile page for users.  Allow people to follow their favorite users.
4. Make a search feature for certain recipes and categories.
5. Put more recipes in the database.  In fact, generate a Python program to do just that (that would be fun!)
6. Make a "Next Page" or "Previous Page" for recipies.
7. Tweak the recipe algorithm.
8. Make an About page, a Terms of Use page, and a Privacy Policy page.
